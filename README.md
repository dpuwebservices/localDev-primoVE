# The Primo New UI Customization Workflow Development Environment
 https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-devenv
 
## Current Issues

- SCSS not watching in the correct location, so not picking up changes. Temp workaround: create a temp config.rb file and manually run compass watch function (which needs to be run from command line outside of VS Code) 

- Cannot verify I-Share button styling (from creating new repo) until borrowing turned back on 

-Using NVM to manage node versions. Use following command below before starting server.
```
nvm use 10.15.3
```

## Quick Start


 

```bash
# run production
yarn runprod
```

```bash
# create package for production
yarn packprod
```

```bash
# backup create package
package=01CARLI_DPU-CARLI_DPU; cd primo-explore/custom; zip -r \"../../packages/${package}.zip\" $package -x \"*.DS_Store\" -x \"**/*.scss\"; cd ../../
```

- [open link in browser](http://localhost:8003/discovery/search?vid=01CARLI_DPU-CARLI_DPU)


### (from Allan) UIC config

UIC-specific config are in these files:
- /README.md (this file)
- /package.json
- /gulp/config.js
- /src
  -  just a handly place for keeping original source files
- /primo-explore/custom/
  - this is where you put your Primo package; you can download it originally from Alma discovery configuration section

Code in other files/directories is generated by Gulp.



The following text is from the original repository.

<hr />

## Structure

- <b>gulp directory</b> : holds the various build scripts for the environment and the <b>config.js</b> configuration file in which your target proxy-server must be defined.

- <b>node_modules directory</b> : holds the various third-party modules that are required to run the system. These modules are defined in the <b>package.json</b> file.

- <b>packages directory</b> : once your development package is ready you will be able to build it using the `gulp create-package` command that will create the zipped package file you define in this folder

- <b>primo-explore directory</b> : consists of 2 directories :
  1.  <b>custom</b> : - where you will place your customization packages
  2.  <b>tmp</b> : just a place to hold some of your temporary files

## Overview

The development package allows you to configure the following page components (follow the links for details):

- [CSS](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/css "css documentation")

- [HTML](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/html "html documentation")

- [Images](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/img "images documentation")

- [JavaScript](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/js "javascript documentation")

For each configuration-type, or for every different Primo View, there should be a specified folder named after the View (which adheres to the established directory structure) in the `primo-explore/custom` package folder.

This custom View folder can be downloaded from your Primo Back Office, by following `Primo Home > Primo Utilities > UI customization Package Manager`, or started fresh from the [primo-explore-package GitHub repository](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package "primo-explore-package repository"). (The benefit of using this repository is that in each folder you will find a specific README.md file containing recipes and examples.)

## Installation

1.  Download the project from this repository and place it on your computer

2.  Unzip the file you downloaded to a preferred development project folder location

3.  Download and install the [Node version 6.9.2](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v6.9.2/)

4.  From command line, run the command : `npm install npm@3.3.12 -g`

5.  Restart your computer

6.  From command line, run the command : `npm install -g gulp`

7.  In a <b>new</b> command line window, navigate to the project base directory (`cd \path\to\your\project\folder\primo-explore-devenv`)

8.  From command line, run the command : `npm install` (This should install all node modules needed for gulp.)

    ![npm install image](./help_files/npmInstall.png "Running npm install")

9.  Edit Gulp configuration file's <i>proxy server</i> setting, found at <b>gulp/config.js</b> : `var PROXY_SERVER = http://your-server:your-port` (Make sure to use your real Sandbox or Production Primo Front-End URL.) Note that for SSL environments (HTTPS) define the server as: `var PROXY_SERVER = https://your-server:443`

10. Populate your custom View package folder in the custom package folder ("...primo-explore\custom"), by either downloading the view code files from your Primo Back Office or using the [primo-explore-package GitHub repository](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package "primo-explore-package repository")) to start a new package folder. (if you have already defined a view package and loaded it to the BO - make sure you download it or else you will not see, and may overwrite, your previous changes.)

- If your custom view package folder were to be called "Auto1" then your development environment directory tree should look similar to this:
  ![Directory tree image](./help_files/direcoryTree.png "Directory tree")

- <b>IMPORTANT:</b> The name of your custom view package folder must match an <i>existing</i> view on the proxy server being referenced or the Gulp server will not function properly. For development from scratch, be sure to first create (or copy) a view using the Primo Back Office View Wizard; then you can accomplish your customizations locally using this document.

11. Start your code customizations :

- From command line, run the command : `gulp run --view <the VIEW_CODE folder>` (This will start your local server.)

  (For example, running `gulp run --view Auto1` will start the environment taking the customizations from the <b>Auto1</b> folder.)

  ![Server Startup Image](./help_files/serverStartup.png "Server Startup")

- For Primo VE customers, add the --ve flag :
  `gulp run --view <the VIEW_CODE folder> --ve`
- Open a browser and type in the following URL : `localhost:8003/primo-explore/?vid=your-view-code` (Example: http://localhost:8003/primo-explore/search?vid=Auto1)
- For Primo VE customers open the following URL : `localhost:8003/discovery/?vid=your-institution-code:your-view-code`

- Now you should be able to to your customizations with real searches and results, from your previously defined proxy-server. Note: once you start working with this environment, you will discover that the best results are achieved by working in your browser's incognito mode; or you can clear your browser cache before you start the Gulp server.

![Env up Image](./help_files/searchResults.png "Env up")

- You can get immediate feedback on your code changes by refreshing the browser.

- Perform your changes according to the documentation/examples in:

  - [CSS](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/css "css documentation")

  - [HTML](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/html "html documentation")

  - [Images](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/img "images documentation")

  - [JavaScript](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/primo-explore-package/tree/master/VIEW_CODE/js "javascript documentation")

Note: you have multiple options to edit the css file(custom1.css) and the js file(custom.js), some of them include methods of splitting your developments to seperate files. When using such methods - the css and js file will be overriden by the different files.

## Publishing packages

Once you finish customizing the package, you can zip up that directory and upload it using the Primo BackOffice.

1. In a command line window, navigate to the project base directory : `cd \path\to\your\project\folder\primo-explore-devenv`

2. From command line, run the command : `gulp create-package` You will be prompted with a menu specifying all of the possible packages you can build, such as :

   ![Create Package Image](./help_files/createPackage.png "Create Package up")

   ![Package Image](./help_files/packages.png "Package up")

3. Log into Primo Back Office and navigate to the <b>UI customization Package manager</b> section : `Primo Home > Primo Utilities > UI customization Package Manager`

4. Use the file <b>browse</b> button to find and upload the new zipped package file. (Located in the "\path\to\your\project\folder\primo-explore-devenv\package" directory.)

   ![BO Image](./help_files/bo.png "BO up")

5. Don't forget to <b>deploy</b> your changes

## Publishing Primo-Studio addons

Once you finish customizing the package, you can get it ready to be published to Primo-Studio.

1. In a command line window, navigate to the project base directory : `cd \path\to\your\project\folder\primo-explore-devenv`

2. From command line, run the command : `gulp prepare-addon` You will be prompted with a menu specifying all of the possible packages you can build.

3. Once you finished running the script a folder containing the add-on will be created in `\path\to\your\project\folder\primo-explore-devenv\addons`.

4. From the above folder you can publish your add-on to NPM and to Primo-Studio. For Instructions see: [Primo-Studio add-on tutorial](https://github.com/ExLibrisGroup/Primo-Studio-Addon-Tutorial)
